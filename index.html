    <h1>Guoxuan Xu</h1>
    <p>
        Hi, I am Guoxuan(徐国轩), or you can call me Jason. I am currently a third-year undergraduate student studying
        Data Science at University of California San Diego (UCSD). While I am exploring specific domain to focus on 
        for long term, my interest lie in bioinformatic and machine learning. These fields offer a rich combination 
        challenges, transferable skills, and impactful applications that resonate deeply with me.

        This is my personal image. I took it at Gilderport near ERC UCSD in the morning. It was pretty cold over there in
        early time but all worth it for an image
    </p>
